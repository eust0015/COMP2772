        <p class="second-section-feature-paragraph">
          Acoustic Noise Cancelling™ — it started right here with the original QuietComfort® headphones. And now it’s better than ever. With an additional external microphone (for a total of six) and enhanced signal
          processing, QC45 headphones dramatically cancel out noise so it doesn’t reach your ears.
        </p>
        <span class="second-section-feature">More music. And awareness. </span>
        <p class="second-section-feature-paragraph">
          Aware Mode brings the outside world in with microphones that pick up the sounds around you and play them naturally through the headphones. It’s your music and your environment at the same time.
